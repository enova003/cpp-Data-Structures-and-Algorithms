# Description
This repository showcases some examples of my coding projects from CS 361 - Data Structures and Algorithms, a course I completed at Old Dominion University. Throughout the semester, I had the opportunity to work on a series of challenging programming assignments that were designed to teach me the fundamental concepts and principles of data structures and algorithms.

In each project, I was provided with a set of .cpp and .h files that formed part of a larger program. The professor then tasked us with implementing a series of empty functions, which required me to think critically and creatively to solve the problems at hand. In each folder, the files containing the functions that I implemented are provided. These projects were carefully crafted to introduce me to various concepts and techniques, including:

- Iterators
- Vectors
- Lists
- Deques
- Queues
- Trees
- Recursion
- Generic Programming
- Maps
- Sets
- Hashing
- Graphs

Additionally, this class heavily focused on the analysis of time and space complexity of code using Big-O notation.
